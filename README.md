1.Python Program: Calculate Factorial of a Number

This repository contains a Python program that:
1. Defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument.
2. Calculates the factorial of the number using a loop or recursion.
3. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

Program Description

The program defines a function `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a given number. Factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to the given number. For example:
- The factorial of `5` is `5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`.
- The factorial of `0` is defined as `1`.

The program can calculate the factorial either using a loop or recursion, and it returns the result. The function is then called with a sample number, and the result is printed.

Output
Enter a number: 5
The factorial of 5 is: 120

2.Python Program: Mathematical Calculations Using the `math` Module

This repository contains a Python program that:
1. Asks the user to input a number.
2. Uses the `math` module to perform the following calculations:
   - Square root of the number
   - Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
   - Sine of the number (in radians)
3. Displays the calculated results.

Program Description

The program prompts the user to enter a number. It then performs the following calculations using the `math` module:
1. Square root: The program calculates the square root of the number using `math.sqrt()`.
2. Natural logarithm: It calculates the natural logarithm (log base e) using `math.log()`.
3. Sine: It calculates the sine of the number assuming the input is in radians using `math.sin()`.

The results of these calculations are then displayed on the screen.

Output
Enter a number: 25

The square root of 25 is: 5.0
The natural logarithm (log base e) of 25 is: 3.2188758248682006
The sine of 25 radians is: -0.13235175009777303
